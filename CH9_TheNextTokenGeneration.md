# Decoding the Next Token in Transformers: Understanding Output Vectors

Transformers are powerful models used in various tasks like text generation, machine translation, and summarization. In these applications, the model's output often has the shape `torch.Size([BATCH_SIZE, SEQ_LEN, VOCAB_SIZE])`. This output contains the logits for each token position in the sequence, representing predictions for the vocabulary distribution.

A key step in autoregressive generation (e.g., GPT models) is selecting the next token based on this output. This blog explores how the next token is chosen and debates whether to use the first token, last token, or an average of all tokens.

## **Understanding the Output Vector**

The transformer output, `torch.Size([BATCH_SIZE, SEQ_LEN, VOCAB_SIZE])`, can be broken down as follows:
- **BATCH_SIZE**: Number of sequences in the batch.
- **SEQ_LEN**: Sequence length, representing predictions for each token position.
- **VOCAB_SIZE**: The size of the vocabulary, with logits indicating the likelihood of each token.

During generation, the sequence grows iteratively. At each step, the model appends one token to the input based on its prediction.

## **How to Select the Next Token?**

Typically, to generate the next token, we focus on the **last token position** in the sequence, which corresponds to the most recent prediction. Here's the reasoning:

### **Last Token: The Standard Approach**
- Extract the logits for the last position in the sequence:
  ```python
  last_token_logits = outputs[:, -1, :]  # Shape: [BATCH_SIZE, VOCAB_SIZE]
  ```
- Convert logits to probabilities:
  ```python
  probabilities = torch.nn.functional.softmax(last_token_logits, dim=-1)
  ```
- Sample or select the token with the highest probability:
  ```python
  next_token = torch.argmax(probabilities, dim=-1)  # Greedy decoding
  ```

This approach works because transformers are designed to output predictions conditioned on the entire input sequence. The last position provides the most context-aware prediction.

### **First Token: A Less Common Choice**
Instead of the last position, you might consider using the **first token’s logits** for next-token generation:
```python
first_token_logits = outputs[:, 0, :]  # Shape: [BATCH_SIZE, VOCAB_SIZE]
```

**Why might this be problematic?**
- The first token represents predictions influenced heavily by the input sequence's initial tokens. It doesn't account for recent context added during autoregressive generation.
- In tasks requiring coherent generation, this approach may produce irrelevant or inconsistent outputs.

---

### **Averaging All Tokens: A Hypothetical Approach**
Another approach is to compute the average logits across all sequence positions:
```python
average_logits = outputs.mean(dim=1)  # Shape: [BATCH_SIZE, VOCAB_SIZE]
```

**Pros**:
- By averaging, you incorporate information from all token positions.
- This may smooth out anomalies in any individual token's logits.

**Cons**:
- Transformers are autoregressive models. The outputs for earlier tokens (especially padding positions) are less relevant during generation.
- Averaging dilutes the importance of the last token's context, which is critical for coherent predictions.

## **Comparison of Methods**

| Method               | **Advantages**                                   | **Disadvantages**                                  |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Last Token**        | Most context-aware prediction. Standard method. | No significant disadvantages.                     |
| **First Token**       | May work for specific tasks or positional biases. | Ignores the updated context from generation steps.|
| **Average of Tokens** | Incorporates global information across tokens.  | Dilutes critical context of the last token.       |

---

## **Practical Considerations**

- **Use Case**: For text generation tasks, always prioritize the last token, as it reflects the latest context.
- **Special Tasks**: In some cases (e.g., summarization), you might experiment with alternative methods if the task benefits from global sequence information.
- **Performance Impact**: Most standard transformer implementations assume the last token is used during autoregressive generation.

## **Code Snippet: Generating the Next Token**

Here’s a complete example using the last token for next-token generation:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Example transformer output
BATCH_SIZE = 2
SEQ_LEN = 5
VOCAB_SIZE = 10
outputs = torch.randn(BATCH_SIZE, SEQ_LEN, VOCAB_SIZE)  # Simulated logits

# Extract last token logits
last_token_logits = outputs[:, -1, :]  # Shape: [BATCH_SIZE, VOCAB_SIZE]

# Convert to probabilities
probabilities = F.softmax(last_token_logits, dim=-1)

# Sample next token (or use argmax for greedy decoding)
next_token = torch.argmax(probabilities, dim=-1)  # Shape: [BATCH_SIZE]
print("Next token:", next_token)
```

---

## **Conclusion**

For most tasks, focusing on the **last token** is the optimal approach for next-token generation in transformers. While exploring alternatives like the first token or averaging might be interesting for research, they often compromise context relevance and coherence.

Transformers are context-driven models. Leveraging the latest token prediction ensures the output aligns with the sequential dependencies of the input.
